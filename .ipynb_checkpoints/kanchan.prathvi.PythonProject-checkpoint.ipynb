    "# Question 1\n",
    "## (100 points) The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ) tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis.  Specifically, the most active, the top gainers and top losers are listed at any instance in time. You will first write Python scripts that collect the list of most actives, gainers and losers from the above website. Next, your programs should take the ticker symbols and names of these companies (and categories) and build a csv file (called stocks.csv) with data about each stock from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1  which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example. Your code should also list the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the website: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and ask the user to choose a company to get the data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, your program should display its corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume and Market Cap). \n",
    "\n",
    "# _Algorithm_\n",
    "1. Import the required libraries like requests, install beautifulSoup in the system using pip install requests beautifulsoup4. \n",
    "2. Fetch the source code of the page loaded by the url https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/. Extract most active, gainers and losers information and store it in list. Use beautiful soup to scrap the webpage.\n",
    "3. Create a csv stocks.csv file and update it with the information in Step2\n",
    "3. When the user enters the required company from the list of companies displayed,from http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1 extract open, market Cap, volume, previous close of the companies in real time as the data keeps changing.\n",
    "4. Display the required results\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# _Instructions to run the code_\n",
    "1. Run the below cell each time to see the output.\n",
    "2. When prompted to Enter your Interested Company, enter the ticker symbol like AMD, GE, etc\n",
    "3. If the user inputs Anything other than ticker symbol, the error message Kindly enter valid input is displayed.\n",
